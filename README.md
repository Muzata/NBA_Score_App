# NBA_Score_App
Home task from Interview

I wanted to create the app (SQLite.sln) with the user ability to ADD scores to the data table (DBInfo) and then showing same data table in data grid view (dataGridView1) where user can search for specific team with drop down menu.

The process of adding data (Home Team, Away Team, Score) to the database (test.db3) is working excellent, but I got confused how to link back test.db3 into the dataGridView1. 
If the DBInfo is linked with the dataGridView1, the top scores can be displayed by making the Score column sortable by user.
